============================== QUICK START GUIDE ==============================
1)  Install https://github.com/bwestley/remote-input on a linux device.
2)  Configure the remote input server with a "config.toml" file such as the
    template in this manual. If a "config.toml" file cannot be found, a default
    matching this template will be automatically installed.
3)  Start the remote input server.
4)  Open settings.
5)  Set the server address and API key.
6)  Press "Connect" in the main window to connect to the configured remote
    input server.
7)  Select output devices.
8)  Set keybinds:
  - To clear: right click.
  - To set: left click before pressing a key on the remote. Left click again to
    cancel.
9)  Close settings.
10) Add a new sound by filling the following fields from left to right before
    clicking the "Add" button.
  - Name
  - Key: see step 8
  - Volume: drag the slider or enter a number
  - Path: type in a path or click and drag a file
11) Click the large toggle switch to enable the soundboard.
12) On the remote, press the key that was selected in step 10 to play that
    sound!

============================== KEY BIND BUTTONS ===============================
Key bind buttons store a specific key to trigger behavior when that key is
    later pressed on that remote.
To clear: right click.
To set: left click before pressing a key on the remote. Left click again to
    cancel.

=================================== SOUNDS ====================================
A sound can be added by pressing the "Add" button on the top row of the sounds
table. The fields will then be moved down into the next row. These can be
edited at any time. The sound-specific volume and keybind settings take effect
immediately. Press the "^" or "v" buttons to move the sounds up or down the
list. The order of sounds has no effect. Press the "Remove" button to delete
that sound. The indicator on the left of each sound shows if the sound is
stopped, playing, or paused. When the sound ends, the indicator still shows
that it is playing. Pressing the pause button (as configured in the settings
menu under "Shortcuts") will pause all playing sounds. Pressing it again will
play all paused sounds. Pressing the stop button (as configured...) will stop
all playing and paused sounds. Pressing the modifier button (as configured...)
will cause the the next button pressed to resume/pause playback instead of
restarting play from the beginning of the sound. Pressing the modifier button
again before pressing a sound button, or pressing a sound button will reset the
modifier state.

================================== SETTINGS ===================================
The settings menu can be opened with the "Settings" button. When a audio device
is added or remove from the computer, the audio device list can be updated with
the "Reload Devices" button. Check the box next to each device audio should
play from. The server address may be an IP address or DNS name followed by a
port number (e.g. rpi3.lan:8650 or 192.168.1.58:8650).The remote input server
api key should match what is in the remote server's config.toml tile. The
pause, stop, and modifier keybinds can be changed in the "Shortcuts" section.
See the SOUNDS section of this manual for information on shortcut function and
the KEY BIND BUTTONS section for instructions on how to configure keybinds.
